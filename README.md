# Synesthesia Simulator and Music Visualizer

## What is this project?
This project simulates synesthesia through visualizing the pitch values that are detected through the connected microphone. We have 3D and VR components, and you can install this in your Oculus Go. 

## How to import?
Import the Assets folder in Unity 2019 version. If you like to install the VR application to Oculus Go, change the platform to Androids and install the adk file to your Oculus Go headset. If you don't have Oculus Go, you can still see our 3D environment! Open 3D_MainMenu scene in Assets/Scenes/3D scenes(for submission) and click play. Once you click start, choose your background and ground setting, you are ready to see the Visualizer that detects the pitch values of the sounds around you.
